<h1 style="color:blue;">RECURSIVE FUNCTION</h1>
<ul>
<li>
The process in which function calls itself one or more times in it's body.</li>
<li>The corresponding function is called recursive function.</li>
<li>It is returning the return value of this function.</li>
<li>Using recursive algorithm certain problems can be solved quick early.</li>
<li>A recursion can end up in on infinite loop, if the base case is not met in the calls.</li>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
# An example of a recursive function to
 find the factorial of a number</li>
</ul>
<pre>
<code>
def factorial(x):

    if x == 1:
        return 1
    x = x-1
    return(x*factorial(x-1)
num = 4
print(num)
</code>
</pre>
<ul>
<li>When we call this function with a positive integer, it will recursively call itself by decreasing the number.</li>
<li>Each function call multiples the number with the factorial of number 1 until the number is equal to one. This recursive call can be explained in the following steps.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
<ol>
<li>factorial(4)              # 1st call with 4</li>
<li>4 * factorial(3)          # 2nd call with 3</li>
<li>4 * 3 * factorial(2)      # 3rd call with 2</li>
<li>4 * 3 * 2 * factorial(1)  # 4th call with 1</li>
<li>4 * 3 * 2 * 1                  # return from 4th call as number=1</li>
<li>4 * 3 * 2                      # return from 3rd call</li>
<li>4 * 6                          # return from 2nd call</li>
<li>24                             # return from 1st call</li>
</ol>
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Our recursion ends when the number reduces to 1. This is called the base condition</li>
<li>Every recursive function must have a base condition that stops the recursion or else the function calls itself infinitely.</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="color:red;">RECURSION DEPTH</h1>
<ul>
<li>This is another recursion procedure which is the number of times the procedure is called recursively in the process of enlarging a given argument or arguments.</li>
<li>if recursive call continues without reaching the base case then program never terminates.</li>
<li>python supports maximum recursion depth as 1000 this can be modified according to user requirement.</li>
<li>using sys.setrecursionlimit(500).</li>
</ul>

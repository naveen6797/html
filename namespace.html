<h1>Variable namespace</h1>
<ul><li>Namespace is a collection of names.</li>
<li>In Python, you can imagine a namespace as a mapping of every name, you have defined, to corresponding objects.</li>
<li>A namespace containing all the built-in names is created when we start the Python interpreter and exists as long we don't exit.</li>
<li>This is the reason that built-in functions like , print() etc. are always available to us from any part of the program. Each module creates its own global namespace.</li>
<li>Modules can have various functions and classes. A local namespace is created when a function is called, which has all the names defined in it. Similar, is the case with class.</li></ul>
<h1>Variable Scope</h1>
<ul><li>Although there are various unique namespaces defined, we may not be able to access all of them from every part of the program.</li>
<li>Scope is the portion of the program from where a namespace can be accessed directly without any prefix.</li>
<p>At any given moment, there are at least three nested scopes.</p><ol>
<li>Scope of the current function which has local names</li><li>Scope of the module which has global names</li><li>Outermost scope which has built-in names</li>
</ol><ul><li>When a reference is made inside a function, the name is searched in the local namespace, then in the global namespace and finally in the built-in namespace.</li></ul>
<h2>Example</h2>
<code><pre>
def outer_function():

    b = 20
    
    def inner_func():

        c = 30


a = 10</pre></code>
<p>Here, the variable<p3> a</p3> is in the global namespace. Variable<p3> b </p3>is in the local namespace of <p3>outer_function()</p3> and <p3>c</p3> is in the nested local namespace of <p3>inner_function()</p3>.</p>
<p>When we are in <p3>inner_function()</p3>,<p3> c</p3> is local to us,<p3> b</p3> is nonlocal and <p3>a</p3> is global. We can read as well as assign new values to<p3> c </p3>but can only read <p3>b</p3> and<p3> a</p3> from <p3>inner_function()</p3>.</p>

<p>If we try to assign as a value to <p3>b</p3>, a new variable <p3>b</p3> is created in the local namespace which is different than the nonlocal<p3> b</p3>. Same thing happens when we assign a value to <p3>a</p3>.</p>

<p>However, if we declare <p3>a</p3> as global, all the reference and assignment go to the global <p3>a</p3>. Similarly, if we want to rebind the variable <p3>b</p3>, it must be declared as nonlocal. The following example will further clarify this.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<code><pre>
def outer_function():

    a = 20
    
    def inner_function():

    	a = 30

    	print('a =',a)


    
	inner_function()

   	print('a =',a)

a = 10

outer_function()

print('a =',a)

OUTPUT:
a = 30
a = 20
a = 10
</pre>
</code>
<p>In this program, three different variables a are defined in separate namespaces and accessed accordingly. While in the following program</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<code><pre>
def outer_function():

    global a

    a = 20

    def inner_function():

        global a

        a = 30

        print('a =',a)


    inner_function()

    print('a =',a)

     
a = 10

outer_function()

print('a =',a)

OUTPUT:
a = 30
a = 30
a = 30

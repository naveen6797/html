<h1 style="color:blue;">FILES:</h1>
<ul>
<li>File is a named location on disk to store related information. It is used to permanently store data in a non-volatile memory (e.g. hard disk).</li>
<li>Since, random access memory (RAM) is volatile which loses its data when computer is turned off, we use files for future use of the data.</li>
<li>When we want to read from or write to a file we need to open it first. When we are done, it needs to be closed, so that resources that are tied with the file are freed.</li>
<li>Hence, in Python, a file operation takes place in the following order.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Open a file</li>
<li>Read or write</li>
<li>Close the file</li>
</ol>
<h1 style="color:blue;">OPENING A FILE:</h1>
<P>Python has a built-in function open() to open a file. This function returns a file object, also called a handle, as it is used to read or modify the file accordingly.</p>
<pre>
syntax:
f = open(file_name, mode="r")
</pre>
<ul>
<li>We can specify the mode while opening a file. In mode, we specify whether we want to read 'r', write 'w' or append 'a' to the file. We also specify if we want to open the file in text mode or binary mode.</li>
<li>The default is reading in text mode. In this mode, we get strings when reading from the file.</li>
<li>binary mode returns bytes and this is the mode to be used when dealing with non-text files like image or exe files.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Python File Modes</h3>
<ul>
<li>'r' - oepn a file for reading.<li>
<li>'w' - Open a file for writing. Creates a new file if it does not exist or truncates the file if it exists.</li>
<li>'x' - Open a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, the operation fails.</li>
<li>'a' - Open a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, the operation fails.</li>
<li>'t' - open in tetx mode.i.e.the data will be processed as text.</li>
<li>'b' - open in binary mode.i.e. the data will be processed as bytes.</li>
<li>'+' - open a file for updating(i.e. both reading and writing)</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to close a file Using Python?</h3>
<li>When we are done with operations to the file, we need to properly close the file.</li>
<li>closing a file using close() method in python.</li>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
f = open("test.txt", mode = 'r')
#perform file operations

f.close()
</pre>
<li>This way, we are guaranteed that the file is properly closed even if an exception is raised, causing program flow to stop.</li>
<li>The best way to do this is using the with statement. This ensures that the file is closed when the block inside with is exited.</li>
<li>We don't need to explicitly call the close() method. It is done internally.</li>
<h3>syntax:</h3>
<pre>
with open("test.txt",mode = 'r') as f:
   # perform file operations
</pre>
<h2>How to write to file using python?</h2>
<ul>
<li>In order to write into a file in Python, we need to open it in write 'w', append 'a' or exclusive creation 'x' mode.</li>
<li>We need to be careful with the 'w' mode as it will overwrite into the file if it already exists. All previous data are erased.</li>
<li>Writing a string or sequence of bytes (for binary files) is done using write() method. This method returns the number of characters written to the file.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
with open("test.txt",'w', mode = 'r') as f:
     f.write("my first file\n")
     f.write("my second file\n")
     f.write("my third file\n")
</pre>
<li>This program will create a new file named 'test.txt' if it does not exist. If it does exist, it is overwritten.</li>
<h2>How to read files in python?</h2>
<ul>
<li>read a file in Python, we must open the file in reading mode.</li>
<li>We can use the read(size) method to read in size number of data. If size parameter is not specified, it reads and returns up to the end of the file.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
